# use-views

A tool to help you install Views in your create-react-app or create-react-native-app project

## React DOM
Using [create-react-app](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).

```
npm install --global create-react-app use-views
create-react-app my-app
cd my-app
use-views
npm start
```

## React Native
Using [create-react-native-app](https://github.com/react-community/create-react-native-app)

```
npm install --global create-react-native-app use-views
create-react-native-app my-native-app
cd my-native-app
use-views
```

Running the iOS simulator
```
npm run ios
```

Running the Android simulator
```
npm run android
```

Sometimes the simulator fails to load. You will want to stop the command by pressing
`ctrl+c` and running `npm start` instead. If the simulator is already open,
press the button to try again.

You can also use a real device for testing, [see this](https://github.com/react-community/create-react-native-app#npm-run-ios)
for more info.
