# Create Views App

A tool to help you create a Views with for web or native

[Looking for Views Tools docs?](https://docs.views.tools)

## React DOM

### With Yarn
```
yarn create react-app my-app
cd my-app
yarn create views-app
yarn start
```

### With NPM
```
npx create-react-app my-app
cd my-app
npx create-views-app
npm start
```

## React Native

### With Yarn
```
yarn create react-native-app my-app
cd my-app
yarn create views-app
yarn start
```

### With NPM
```
npx create-react-native-app my-app
cd my-app
npx create-views-app
npm start
```

Running the iOS simulator

```
npm run ios
```

Running the Android simulator

```
npm run android
```

Sometimes the simulator fails to load. You will want to stop the command by pressing
`ctrl+c` and running `npm start` instead. If the simulator is already open,
press the button to try again.

You can also use a real device for testing, [see this](https://github.com/react-community/create-react-native-app#npm-run-ios)
for more info.
